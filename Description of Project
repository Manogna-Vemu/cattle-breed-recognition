This project is developed to automatically identify the breed of cattle and buffalo from images. 
India has many different breeds, and many of them look very similar.
Because of this, manual identification is often difficult and can lead to mistakes.
An automated system can help farmers and livestock authorities identify breeds more accurately and make better decisions.

The system uses a deep learning model based on the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network. 
The model is trained using images of 41 different cattle and buffalo breeds. 
Before giving the images to the model, they are converted to RGB format, resized to 150×150 pixels, and normalized. 
This helps the model process the images more efficiently and learn important visual features like body shape, coat pattern, and horn structure.

When an image is uploaded, it is preprocessed and passed to the trained model. 
The model predicts the probabilities for all breed classes and selects the breed with the highest probability. 
The system then displays the predicted breed, whether it is cattle or buffalo, and a confidence score.

The confidence score is used to evaluate the prediction. 
If the confidence is above 50%, the result is considered valid. 
If it is below 50%, the prediction is marked as low confidence. 
This helps prevent unreliable results.
